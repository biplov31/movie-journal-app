      <h1>I cried all night and my tear ducts are sore.</h1>
      <span>By <i>anon</i></span>
      <span>- 24<sup>th</sup> February</span>
      <p>As the title states, I watched an emotional movie and got immensely sentimental yesterday. One thing led to another, and I started doing my chores in the middle of the night. Mind you, tears are still rolling from my eyes. Both of them. Eventually I started cleaning a tabletop because why not. But as I was wiping the glass surface, tears were rolling down my cheecks and then off of my chin splashing on to the tabletop making it dirty. This phenomenon went on for a while. I started cleaning the glass surface more rigorously trying to rid it of any tear whatsoever. Deep down, however, I knew I was failing and was a huge disappointment to myself and also my family, this further amplified the rate at which the tears were falling. By now I'm sure you can see that a vicious cycle was in effect. The battle of the relentless tears and the mighty tabletop has commenced. After a while, I vaguely remember fainting out of sheer exhaustion and sorrow, and falling on to the table. The glass top, unable to withstand the weight of my body, shattered into smitherines. 
        <br>I woke up to what could certainly qualify as a battlefield. In light of that disastrous chain of events, I have decided not to disclose the name of the movie that started it all. Keeping in mind the safety concerns of my fellow citizens, I am willing to die on that hill. Thank you!
